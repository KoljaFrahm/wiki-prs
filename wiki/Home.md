# Input Leap

## General

There is quite a bit to be added to our wiki here on GitHub. As time permits and
as the project progresses we will be adding bits of information to the wiki. For
now we wanted to share our binary downloads for stable builds. Stay tuned for
more!

*Current Version:*: 2.4.0 - v3.0.0 coming **very** soon!

## Binary Downloads

Work in progress, we're looking into signed Windows and macOS builds.

You can pick up unsigned *debug* build artifacts from GitHub Actions.
